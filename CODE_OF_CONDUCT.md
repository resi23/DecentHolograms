# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
Look, we’re all tired here, and nobody wants drama. So, let’s keep the DecentHolograms project a somewhat bearable, mostly drama-free zone. We solemnly pledge to make this experience as harassment-free as humanly possible (whatever’s left of our humanity at this point).
## Expected Behavior
- Respect others’ opinions. Even if you think they’re wild. Especially then.
- Try to give feedback that’s actually helpful – we’re not here for therapy, but if you need to vent, we get it.
- Remember, everyone’s time is precious. Especially those of us who’d rather be napping.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Anything that involves cringe-worthy language, imagery, or weird flirting. This is not the app for that.
- Personal attacks, name-calling, or anything resembling a keyboard warrior moment. We’re all just tired.
- Endless trolling, arguing for sport, or aggressively taking a conversation off the rails. We’ve got no energy for these games.

## Not Expected But Acceptable Behavior
- Using `final` Excessively as a Symbol of Determination: Every dev copes differently. If making every variable final gets you through the day, we support you.

## Burnout Survival Tips
- Go outside, drink water, try to forget that Singleton pattern exists.
- If your build breaks for the third time, feel free to go off. Just keep it friendly – we all understand.

## Enforcement
The maintainers have the power to delete, edit, reject, ban, or otherwise banish any comments, code, or contributions that suck the soul out of this project. Any contributors getting too wild can take a timeout – or a permanent nap from the project. This isn’t high school; we don’t do drama here.

## The Burnout Clause
Look, we all have those moments staring at an endless stack trace, wondering, “Is this it?” Just know you’re not alone. Take a break, take a nap, or take some time off the debugger – we’ll still be here battling the code gremlins when you’re back.
